The recognition of cultural heritage, such as traditional food, is essential. It teaches us about who we are as a people and as a culture. Let's take Rendang, for example, one of the most well-known Indonesian Traditional Food, renowned both domestically and internationally. Although now seen as almost a daily meal served in Padang Restaurants, it used to and still holds a solid cultural and ceremonial connotation with a rich history, even intertwined with the Indonesian Revolution. This is information that most laypeople would not be able to have, even if they are interested in it. This rich, almost fractal-like, intriguing information that can be discovered on traditional foods should be easy to access, especially with modern technology, and as it is becoming increasingly common for younger generations to drift out of touch with their cultural roots as a result of globalization and homogenization of the world's population. Concerns about other cultures claiming indigenous culinary heritage can also be countered if the knowledge of said food is widespread.

Based on this problem, that is the reason for us to make a Image recognition classification for Indonesia food called **MAKARA: Makanan Khas Nusantara** using the CNN algorithm to classify each Indonesia food. We hope this whill make it easier for tourist to know about Indonesian food varieties.
