# **[Bangkit 2023] CH2-PS252 Product-Based Capstone Project**
The recognition of cultural heritage, such as traditional food, is essential. It teaches us about who we are as a people and as a culture. Let's take Rendang, for example, one of the most well-known Indonesian Traditional Food, renowned both domestically and internationally. Although now seen as almost a daily meal served in Padang Restaurants, it used to and still holds a solid cultural and ceremonial connotation with a rich history, even intertwined with the Indonesian Revolution. This is information that most laypeople would not be able to have, even if they are interested in it. This rich, almost fractal-like, intriguing information that can be discovered on traditional foods should be easy to access, especially with modern technology, and as it is becoming increasingly common for younger generations to drift out of touch with their cultural roots as a result of globalization and homogenization of the world's population. Concerns about other cultures claiming indigenous culinary heritage can also be countered if the knowledge of said food is widespread.

Based on this problem, that is the reason for us to make a Image recognition classification for Indonesia food called **MAKARA: Makanan Khas Nusantara** using the CNN algorithm to classify each Indonesia food. We hope this whill make it easier for tourist to know about Indonesian food varieties.

## Background üìë
Makara is an android application that aims to introduce/enhance/develop the culinary culture of the archipelago, increase opportunities for the culinary industry in Indonesia, and of course make it easier for users, especially in finding local Indonesian specialities easily and provide more experience in using this culture-based application.

## Features ‚úíÔ∏è
- Indonesian food image prediction
- Articles that provide cultural descriptions of the food
